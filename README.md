update_hosts_fromweb.sh - Bash Script that gets the awesome hosts file from [This Awesome Website](https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm). which is an amazing easy way to block some if not most advertisement and annoying stuff on the web. Simply curls this, backs up and replaces your etc/hosts. This is right for macos bigsur. Your hosts file could be in a slightly different place based on your OS.
